## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Details

### Test Environment Setup
```typescript
// Career counselor test configuration
const testConfig = {
  careersDatabase: 'career-database.ts',
  testUsers: [
    { stream: 'PCM', interests: ['technology', 'engineering'] },
    { stream: 'PCB', interests: ['healthcare', 'research'] },
    { stream: 'Commerce', interests: ['finance', 'business'] },
    { stream: 'Arts', interests: ['creative', 'media'] }
  ],
  performanceThresholds: {
    queryResponseTime: 2000, // ms
    searchAccuracy: 0.95,
    recommendationRelevance: 0.85
  }
};
```

## üéØ Best Practices for Career Tests

### Writing Career Tests
```typescript
// Example: Testing career recommendations
it('should recommend appropriate careers for PCM students', async (runtime) => {
  const studentQuery = "I'm in 12th PCM and like solving problems";
  const response = await runtime.agent.processQuery(studentQuery);

  expect(response.careers).toContain('Software Engineer');
  expect(response.careers).toContain('Data Scientist');
  expect(response.relevanceScore).toBeGreaterThan(0.8);
});

// Example: Testing salary filtering
it('should filter careers by salary range', async (runtime) => {
  const budgetQuery = "careers with salary between 5-10 lakhs";
  const results = await runtime.careerDatabase.searchBySalary(500000, 1000000);

  results.forEach(career => {
    expect(career.averageSalary.entry).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(500000);
    expect(career.averageSalary.entry).toBeLessThanOrEqual(1000000);
  });
});
```

### Career Data Validation
```typescript
// Validate career data completeness
it('should have complete information for all careers', () => {
  careerDatabase.forEach(career => {
    expect(career.averageSalary).toBeDefined();
    expect(career.education.stream).toHaveLengthGreaterThan(0);
    expect(career.skills).toHaveLengthGreaterThan(0);
    expect(career.pros).toHaveLengthGreaterThan(0);
  });
});
```

## üîß Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Test Failures
